# HYPER II Huntsman Knife
The Huntsman knife is based on the real-life MX-8054 tactical knife. Its unique saw back serrations along the spine and tanto-style edge makes it one of the most iconic knives in popular games like CS:GO. The HYPER II Huntsman Knife is reminiscent of the popular CS:GO Hyperbeast skin.
