# M9 Bayonet: Tiger
This M9 Bayonet Tiger's striped animalistic finish will be a great addition to any evolving gaming setup or knife collection. Reminscent of the popular CSGO Tiger Tooth skin.

This knife is made from an ABS Fibreglass Handle & 52 HRC Stainless Steel. Also, all our knives include Deluxe Coating which ensures the paintwork is durable and difficult to damage. Giving you the extra security in the knife's strength, paintwork & build quality.

# Digital Twin
Every knife NFT from Deluxe Knives comes with a free physical knife replica! The physical component is perfect for collectors, gaming setup, and everyday use. The digital component is ready for flexing in the metaverse. 

Be careful when purchasing the NFT second hand, as every NFT can be redeemed for a physical twin only once. Check if your NFT has been redeemed here:

Purchasing an NFT that has already been redeemed will not entitle you to a new phyiscal knife, but you will still be able to access metaverse components.
